## CRUD API using NodeJS, npm and Express 

This is a simple application that I've developed to understand the basic usage of http methods on server side. Also, it was a great review of http in general. 
Express is a simple and a fast framework that improves the backend development and its usage is so easy that I could understand in a few minutes reading the documentation. 

Bonus: I learned how to use Insomnia to check the requirements and responses. Loved it!
